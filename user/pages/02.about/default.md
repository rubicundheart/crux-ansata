<h3>About Crux Ansata</h3>
<p>Crux Ansata Oasis is a local chapter of the Ordo Templi Orientis (O.T.O.), located in the Valley of Denver, Colorado.<p>
<p>As an Oasis we strive to provide the people within and without our valley with dramatic group rituals, classes and workshops, and a model of behavior expressing individual light, life, love, and liberty.</p>
<h3>About the O.T.O.</h3>
<p>The Ordo Templi Orientis is a co-fraternal organization, similar to Masonry in the form of structure, which focuses on individual development, personal mastery, and spiritual strength. In essence, we are an international organization of Brothers and Sisters sharing our experiences, knowledge, and support as we all follow our respective paths known in general as the Great Work. Each individualâ€™s Will is their own and can only be discovered then followed via perseverance, an open mind, and a strong foundation. This is what we strive to provide.</p>
