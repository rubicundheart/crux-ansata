          description: The I Ching, or Book of Changes, is one of the oldest books in the world, and has much to offer the modern occultist. In this class we will give a brief overview of the I Ching's history and development, from prehistoric China all the way to today's English translations, as well as a survey of Aleister Crowley's work with and development of the I Ching, in addition to touching on other related divinatory systems. We will discuss it's function as a moral code as well as its use in divination, and how these might be interpreted in the context of New Aeon.</p><p>Suggested donation $5
