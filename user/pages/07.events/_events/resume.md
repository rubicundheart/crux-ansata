          date: July 9th, 2016 3pm - 5pm
          description: This presentation explores the very few oblique and weighty references Aleister Crowley made to the Yezidi and his claim that Thelema is in some way intimately connected with their ancient religion.</p><p>Beginning with the historical context of the reception of the Book of the Law, Crowley’s critical experiences in NYC circa 1918, and his association with the extraordinary and somewhat enigmatic Samuel Aiwaz Jacobs, we examine these weighty assertions. The main body of the lecture includes an introduction to Yezidi culture and an overview of key Yezidi beliefs. These Yezidi traditions are discussed in the context of other ancient Middle Eastern religions. Interesting parallels to Thelema including (but not limited to) ritual practices, cosmology, magical formulae, and sinister forces are identified.</p>          <h4>Bio:</h4>Azi Rasa is a New York State licensed psychologist. He was initiated into OTO in 1988 on his 18th birthday. He is a very active member of Pyramid Lodge where he presents on a broad range of Thelemic topics. He is an ordained Deacon of EGC and frequently serves as novice Priest. A member of the OTO Psychology Guild, he composed a significant portion of the Pastoral Counseling Workshop curriculum. Recently, a small sample of his work (including musical recordings) were featured on a series of episodes of Speech in the Silence.</p><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/1604657853196258/">Add this to your Facebook calendar</a></p><p>Prices are $10 for dues-current members, and $15 for all non-dues-current members or non-members.</p>
