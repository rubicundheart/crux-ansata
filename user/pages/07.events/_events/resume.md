          description:  Come join us for our public performance of Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass.  This ritual is the central rite, both public and private, of the Ordo Templi Orientis.  It is a participatory ritual, meaning that all attendees are expected to take part.  The full script of the ritual can be found <a href="http://lib.oto-usa.org/libri/liber0015.html">here</a>.</p><p>We will begin at 7:00, so we ask that everyone arrives between 6:30 and 6:45 in order to be included in the headcount.</p>A quick reminder: we ask that nobody bring food, drinks, or vape-pens into the temple-space nor into the waiting room.
